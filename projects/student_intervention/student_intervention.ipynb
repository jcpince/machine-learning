      "The  board of director wants computation cost effective model for some budget reason and want to increase the graduation rate from 67% to 95% by helping the students the more likely to fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I'd say that having a good prediction score is good but their score on identifying the students who fail is also very important especially here since the number of students who graduated is twice as important as the number of students who failed so, a dummy predictor predicting always \"passed = yes\" will be have a score of 77% but will not help the detection (see here after for the f1_score of all yes predictions)...\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to get a non computation intensive algorithm, a simple algorithm should be preferred; the storage size might also be important in terms of costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have chosen the following 3 models:\n",
      " - **Gaussian Naive Bayes**:\n",
      "This model is simple, fast and should be the most cost efficient of the 3; it usually gives good results in practice even when the assumption of conditional independance of the features doesn't hold (here, our features should be independant though). It converges quickly on small datasets.\n",
      "On the down side, it is a bad estimator so we will not be able to evaluate the confidence of the predictions and it is sensible to unseen samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "This algorithm is used in the industry for document classification (https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/naivebayes.pdf) or SPAM filtering (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering)\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this is a good candidate since it addresses the cost question; the prediction probability is not a must have here and we have added a 'other' category to some of the features preventing the unseen sample issue.\n",
      " - **Random Forests**:\n",
      "This model is very interesting since, as a part of the ensemble methods, it is very good in terms of generalization compared to the DT which is prone to overfitting. This model tends to decrease the variance which is important here since a dataset is quite small (slightly under 400 samples) and performs well when there are a lot of features. On the bad side, its bias tends to be higher than some other algoritms but the variance being lower usually compensate and provite a better model. And it is not efficient with huge datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The random forests technique is used in the medical field to classify deceases (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062420/ and http://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1094727/document.pdf)\n",
      "\n",
      "I think is is a good candidate given that the number of features is important compared to the number of samples (48 features compared to 300 samples in the training set); The fact that there are not that many samples makes at least one of the ensemble methods worth testing since they share a certain robustness with respect to the overfitting.\n",
      " - **Logistic Regression**:\n",
      "Logistic regression returns a confidence score associated to the prediction. Overfitting can be addressed easily with regularization and it is not particularly sensitive to the dataset noise. The cons of this algorithm is that the computation is expensive with large feature sets, it requires large datasets to preform optimally and is sentible to the multicollinearity (linear dependancy between the features).\n",
      "\n",
      "The logistic regression is used in the medical field in the diagnosis assistance (see http://www.ajronline.org/doi/full/10.2214/AJR.07.3345) or in financial prediction systems (see https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2171511) and many more...\n",
